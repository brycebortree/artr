<h1>The Artr</h1>

<h3>The Artr is an avant garde social media art creator that pulls images from Flickr and tweets from Twitter to create funny or throught provoking juxtapositions.</h3>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
This app was built in Node.js and express. And I used HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, sequelize, postgres, and custom Flickr and Twitter modules to search those respesctive APIs as my primary technologies. Bootstrap was used for CSS styling, and bcrypt was used for password hashing.  

<h2>Strategy Taken</h2>
I initially planned on creating an app that generated one image/tweet set per query. Including multiple images and multiple tweets to search through presented an interesting challenge and ultimately lets users direct their own art pieces, which is more interactive and produces more interesting results. 

<h2>Future Features</h2>
I look forward to continuing working on this project and improving the display of images, making the selection more clear, and including share buttons to social media sites like Instagram and Twitter.
