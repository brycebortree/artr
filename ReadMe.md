<h1> The Artr </h1>

The Artr is a modern art creator that pulls images from Flickr and tweets from Twitter to create funny or throught provoking juxtapositions.

This app was built in Node.js and express. I also used HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, sequelize, postgres, and custom Flickr and Twitter modules as my primary technologies. Bootstrap was used for CSS styling, and bcrypt was used for password hashing.
